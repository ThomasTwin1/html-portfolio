<h3>Yuyuhakuso</h3> 
<p>My favorite anime of all time</p>

<h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
<p>I just love the characters backstories and development. They just grow on you.</p>

<h3>Kingdom of Ruin</h3>
<p>This anime is gruesome, but the storyline and action are epic. 10 out of 10 in my book. Warning: lots of cussing and violence!</p>
